# TODO
 - Update chat updatedAt field on change & resort chat list
 - key so sort by name/param size in model list and model popup

 - popup stack? Probably not needed
 - evict timer + test eviction
 - log filtering?
 - help pages + README
 - scroll bar clicking
 - toggle show thinking
 - model update, delete
 - chat params: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values
 - theme.csv does not seem to work e.g. form invalid
